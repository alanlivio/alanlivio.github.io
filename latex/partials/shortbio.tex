I am currently a postdoc on Machine Learning for Immersive Media (VR/360/Volumetric) and my career can be seen threefold.  In research, I have worked on Video/TV/ML projects and conferences committees (SBC WebMedia and ACM SIGMM), especially interesting in supporting more natural and QoE-oriented multimedia systems. In the industry, I have experienced technology transfer by standard/open-source and collaboration at industry forums (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU SG16). In teaching, I have acted as an undergrad lecturer and postgrad assistant, also seeking to get involved in public engagement and promote student interests in social impact.
