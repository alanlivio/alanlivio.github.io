I am a Computer Scientist with development and interpersonal skills to work in research projects and technology transfer through standards. 
I worked in video/TV/machine-learning research projects (Lavid/UFPB and TeleMÃ­dia/PUC-Rio) and contributed to the Ginga-NCL standards. This way, I acquired experience in research engineering, advising students, research writing, and acting in Technical Program (WebMedia) and standards (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU SG16) committees. 
In my career, I seek to involve in purpose-driven researches, which should help society by professional training, technology transfer to industry, or social impact. In particular, I believe that we can create QoE-driven and human-centric systems by researching the intersection of Multimedia, Human-Computer Interaction, and Machine Learning.
