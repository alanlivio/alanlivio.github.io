    shortbio: >
      I am a Multimedia Researcher with development and interpersonal skills to work on research projects. I am currently a postdoc at UCL working on Immersive Media. I hold a PhD from PUC-Rio and an M.Sc. from UFPB, where I collaborated on TeleMidia and Lavid labs, respectively. During my career, I collaborated on video/TV/machine learning projects, research communities (SBC WebMedia and SIGMM), and standard committees (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU SG16). My research interests are Immersive Media, Interactive Multimedia, and Multimedia Analyses, where I seek to get involved in purpose-driven research with technology transfer to industry or social impact.
    shortbio_social_impact: >
      I truly believe that technology can be a vehicle for social impact, especially in the multimedia field. Today, multimedia/web/video data are spread and are useful for accessibility, governance transparency, minority inclusion, social justice/activism, etc.

          The Brasil4D was funded by the World Bank and focused on Ginga social impact.
          This project performed transmission and digital reception of interactive video applications (using Ginga technology) to 100 low-income families.
          Those applications presented education and health contents, besides labor opportunities.
          The Brazilian Broadcast Community SET awarded Brasil4D as Best interactivity solution.
          It also received awards from the La Cumbre TV Abierta and FRIDA Program because its innovative technological solutions and social impact.
          We describe this impact in a report from the World Bank.
