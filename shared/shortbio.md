I am a Computer Scientist (PhD & Postdoc) interested in geometric Machine Learning (ML) for the next generation of immersive and multimedia systems. My career can be seen threefold. In research, I worked in research projects on Multimedia & ML and contributed to its community (Springer, [ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org) and [SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br)).
In industry, some done research was transferred through opensource and standards at TV forums ([ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16) and [BR TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br)). 
And in teaching, I co-supervised students, acted as a lecturer on under- and post- graduate courses, and organized workshops to promote student interest in public engagement.
