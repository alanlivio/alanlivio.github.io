I am currently a postdoc on Machine Learning for Immersive Media (VR/360), and my career can be seen threefold.
In research, I have contributed to Multimedia & Machine Learning (ML) projects and research committees ([ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org) and [SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br)), being especially interested in the intersection of Multimedia and ML aiming at support more natural and QoE-oriented systems.
In the industry, I have experienced technology transfer by standards and open-source, and collaboration at industry forums ([ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16) and [Brazilian TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br)).
In teaching, I have acted as an undergrad lecturer and postgraduate assistant, and I also seek to get involved in public engagement and promote student interests in social impact.
