I am Computer Scientist (PhD & Postdoc), and my career can be seen threefold.
In research, I have contributed to research projects and committees ([ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org) and [SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br)), and am currently interested in the intersection of Multimedia & Machine Learning.
In the industry, I have added value by contributing to applied projects and standards at industry forums ([ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16) and [BR TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br)).
In teaching, I have acted as an undergrad lecturer and postgraduate assistant, and I also seek to get involved in public engagement and promote student interests in social impact.
