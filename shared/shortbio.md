I am Computer Scientist (PhD & Postdoc), and my career can be seen threefold. First, in research, I have contributed to ML & Multimedia projects and committees ([ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org) and [SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br)). And I am currently interested in ML methods, particularly non-euclidean, for the next generation of immersive and multimedia systems. Second, I have added value to the industry by contributing to applied projects and standards at industry forums ([ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16) and [BR TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br)). And in teaching, I acted as an undergrad lecturer and postgraduate assistant. Also, I got involved in public engagement and promoted student interests in social impact.
