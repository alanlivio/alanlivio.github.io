I am a Computer Scientist (PhD & Postdoc) interested in geometric Machine Learning (ML) for the next generation of immersive systems and graph-based data. My career can be seen threefold. In research, I worked on research Multimedia & ML projects, contributed to communities (Springer, [ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org) and [SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br)), and have been awarded research funding.
In teaching, I co-supervised students, acted as a lecturer on under- and post-graduate courses, and organized workshops to promote student interest in public engagement.
Last, I added value to the industry through open source and standards in TV forums ([ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16) and [BR TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br)).
