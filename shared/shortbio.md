I am currently a postdoc on Machine Learning for Immersive Media (VR/360) and my career can be seen threefold.  In research, I have worked on Video/TV/ML projects and conferences committees ([SBC WebMedia](http://webmedia.org.br) and [ACM SIGMM](http://sigmm.acm.org)), especially interested in supporting more natural and QoE-oriented multimedia systems. In the industry, I have experienced technology transfer by standard/open-source and collaboration at industry forums ([Brazilian TV Forum](http://forumsbtvd.org.br) and [ITU-T SG16](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2022-2024/16)). In teaching, I have acted as an undergrad lecturer and postgrad assistant, also seeking to get involved in public engagement and promote student interests in social impact.
