# cv-site

My website using mkdocs-material and modercv latex
It uses mkdocs-materal inspirations from [Twarner491 personal website](https://github.com/Twarner491/Project-Documentation-Site).  
It uses [modercv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) to create pdf files for CV, letter, memorial, and certificates.
