I am a Lecturer at the University of Reading. I am working on leveraging machine learning for optimizing multimedia systems pipelines for both traditional and immersive (360 videos, point clouds, meshs, etc.) media technologies. Previously, I was a postdoc at UCL working on immersive media and a postdoc at PUC-Rio working on video analysis and interactive TV, I acted team-leading or PI in funded research projects, contributed to ACM SIGMM communities and tandard committees (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU-T SG16). I also seek to get involved in purpose-driven projects with social impact.
