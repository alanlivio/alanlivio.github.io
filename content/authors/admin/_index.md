I am a Lecturer at the University of Reading working on leveraging machine learning to optimise both traditional and immersive media technologies. Previously, I was a postdoc at UCL and did PhD at PUC-Rio. I have experience acting as a team leader or PI in multiple funded research projects (e.g., immersive media, video analysis and interactive TV) and contributed to research communities (ACM SIGMM, SBC WebMedia) and standard committees (ITU-T SG16, Brazilian TV Forum).
