I am a Lecturer at the University of Reading working on the intersection of Multimedia Systems (MM) and Machine Learning (ML). Previously, I was a postdoc at UCL working on immersive media and a postdoc at PUC-Rio working on video analysis and interactive TV. I have been working in my career doing applied research projects, supporting research communities (SBC WebMedia and ACM SIGMM), and supporting standard committees (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU-T SG16). I also seek to get involved in purpose-driven research with technology transfer to industry or social impact.
