          Users' consumption of multimedia content grows exponentially in the Internet, smart devices, social media, and other contexts. Multimedia Systems addresses technological issues for enabling and improving consumption, such as content delivery, adaptation, accessibility and personalisation, and others. See some aspects of my multimedia research below.
          ### Multimedia Systems <i class="fa-solid fa-video-camera"></i>

          Multimedia systems deal with the delivery of multimedia data in digital networks. A multimedia system infrastructure requires components such as protocols, services, middleware, and mechanisms to handle a well-defined quality of service (QoS).

          Some of my contributions in the field are in TV middleware:

          - ðŸ“„ [Advances in Ginga middleware for TV 2.5 (pt-br)](https://set.org.br/news-revista-da-set/artigo-news-revista-da-set/avancos-do-middleware-ginga-para-tv-2-5/)
          - ðŸ“„ [Interactive 360-degree Videos in Ginga-NCL Using Head-Mounted-Displays as Second Screen Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3428658.3430972)
          - ðŸ“„ [Extending multimedia languages to support multimodal user interactions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-016-3846-8)

          For me, some important researchers in this field are:

          ðŸŽ“ [Christian Timmerer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WqVnh0IAAAAJ)

          ### Immersive Media <i class="fa-solid fa-vr-cardboard"></i>

          Immersive media research aims to make multimedia systems more natural and with higher QoE, especially by imitating the physical world through digital simulation. I particularly researched it through VR/360 video and multisensorial aspects.

          Some of my contributions in the field are in 360 videos:

          - ðŸ“„ [Subjective Evaluation of 360-degree Sensory Experiences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8901743)
          - ðŸ“„ [An Authoring Model for Interactive 360 Videos](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9105958)

          For me, some important researchers in this field are:
          ðŸŽ“ [Pablo Cesar, CWI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=guRMl5IAAAAJ),
          ðŸŽ“ [JesÃºs GutiÃ©rrez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=t_WCdAsAAAAJ)
          ðŸŽ“ [Cornelius Hellge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Bb3G13cAAAAJ)

          ### Video Understanding <i class="fa-solid fa-photo-video"></i>

          Video Understanding deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Unlike Multimedia Systems' aspects of delivery and feasibility, it aims to analyse multimedia data automatically. Usage scenarios are video retrieval and browsing, anomaly detection, and others.

          Some of my contributions in the field are unsupervised video analysis:

          - ðŸ“„ [A Clustering-Based Method for Automatic Educational Video Recommendation Using Deep Face-Features of Lecturers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9327972/)
          - ðŸ“„ [Unsupervised method for video action segmentation through spatiotemporal and positional-encoded embeddings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524273.3528187)

          For me, some important researchers in this field are:
          ðŸŽ“ [Richard Szeliski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3_u1jHQAAAAJ)
          ðŸŽ“ [Shaogang Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nhi0I8cAAAAJ)

          ### Social Impact <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle"></i>

          I truly believe technology can be a vehicle for social impact, especially in multimedia. Today, multimedia/web/video data are spread and are useful for accessibility, governance transparency, minority inclusion, social justice/activism, etc.
