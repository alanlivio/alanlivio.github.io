**Project Title:** Computer Vision for Pollination Insects Monitoring (CV-Pollination)  
**Main Supervisor:** Alan Guedes  
**Co-supervisor:** Researcher from UoR Bees Team at Dep. Sustainable Land Management  

Pollinating insects are crucial for agriculture, but current monitoring methods rely on manual techniques that are expensive, labor-intensive, and impractical for large-scale use. This research uses advanced computer vision and multimodal models to analyze existing datasets, integrating environmental factors such as plant species and seasonal variations. Understanding pollinator behavior is essential in the context of climate change, as shifting conditions impact ecosystems and crop productivity. By developing cost-effective and energy-efficient tools, this project aims to enhance understanding of pollination dynamics, providing valuable insights into the relationships between insects, crops, and the environment. The proposed thesis will include the following goals:

* **Dataset creation**: It involves conducting interviews with researchers from UoR Bees Team at Dep. Sustainable Land Management to identify the main visual patterns essential for understanding pollinator insect behavior. These insights will guide the development of models by highlighting factors from an ecological and agricultural perspective, such as plant-pollinator interactions and seasonal variations. This will lead to preparing and curating datasets that capture insect trajectories, flower interactions, and associated environmental metadata. Data augmentation techniques will be applied to enhance diversity and robustness, ensuring that the datasets can support accurate and scalable model development.

* **Advance CV method for insects
 behaviour**: This involves designing and implementing advanced computer vision models to analyze pollinator behavior. These models will emphasize object detection and trajectory analysis to understand insect activity and interaction patterns. Multimodal models will be developed to integrate visual, temporal, and semantic data, such as the types of plants and the time of year. These models aim to provide a holistic understanding of pollinator dynamics, addressing both ecological and agricultural questions.

* **Field validation and real-world application**: This goal will involve conducting field experiments in collaboration with the University of Reading's Sustainable Land Management Department. These experiments will validate the developed models in real-world scenarios, focusing on their ability to provide actionable insights into pollinator behavior and its relationship with agricultural conditions.
