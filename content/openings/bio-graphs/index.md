**Project Title:** Multimodal Graphs for Biodiversity Intactness Index  
**Main Supervisor:** Alan Guedes  
**Co-supervisor:** Researcher from NHM Future Lab  

The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) quantifies the impact of human activities on biodiversity by assessing changes in species abundance across various ecosystems. The Natural History Museum dataset PREDICTS details encompasses species abundance data, land-use types, and environmental changes during time. Futhermore, there is a growing of multimodal biodiversity data, including scientific texts, field images, videos, and environmental reports. However, these valuable data sources often remain siloed, making it challenging to derive interconnected insights and develop a comprehensive understanding of their relationships. To address this challenge, MM-BioGraph focuses on integrating multimodal data into graph-based structures to represent BII relationships. Central to this project is the use novel methods in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). GNNs enable learning a graph-structure of BII, allowing the project to make also predictions about unobserved links or even hypothesize new biodiversity phenomenas. The leverage LLMs to create GNNs models that go beyond traditional biodiversity analyses. These graphs can then be analysed to fill gaps in current BII knowledge and forecast potential changes driven by environmental factors. The proposed thesis will include the goals:

* **BII Multimodal Dataset  Generation**. This aspect focuses on collaboration with specialists from the Natural History Museum to develop a comprehensive multimodal biodiversity dataset. The dataset will include textual, visual, and ecological data, ensuring robust graph representation. A baseline predictive model using graph neural networks (GNNs) will be developed to analyse this dataset, providing an initial framework for identifying species interactions and ecosystem dependencies.

* **Advanced Multimodal Graph methods**. Building on the baseline, this section applies multimodal models using large language models (LLMs) alongside visual data. The aim is to develop a novel method that surpasses the GNN baseline by leveraging the contextual richness of LLMs to predict complex relationships. The improved models will provide insights that are more accurate and comprehensive, setting a new standard for biodiversity graph analysis.

* **Chains of Thought (CoT) for Multimodal Graphs**: The project will also explores leveraging CoT to iteratively refine and enhance the initial solutions by breaking down complex biodiversity challenges into logical, step-by-step reasoning processes. CoT will dynamically interact with the biodiversity dataset, systematically analysing species traits, ecological dependencies, and multimodal data inputs to generate models that progressively improve their understanding of species relationships. This experimental approach aims to expand the boundaries of multimodal model applications in biodiversity, offering a framework for adaptive, interpretable, and self-evolving solutions that align with ecological complexities.
