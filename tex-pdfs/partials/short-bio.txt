I am Multimedia Researcher with development and interpersonal skills to work on research projects. I am currently a postdoc at UCL working on Immersive Media. I hold a PhD (2017) from PUC-Rio and an M.Sc. (2012) from UFPB, where I collaborated on TeleMidia and Lavid labs, respectively. During my career, I collaborated on video/TV/machine learning projects, research communities (SBC WebMedia and SIGMM), and standard committees (Brazilian TV Forum and ITU SG16). My research interests are Immersive Media, Interactive Multimedia, and Multimedia Analyses, where I seek to get involved in purpose-driven research with technology transfer to industry or social impact.
