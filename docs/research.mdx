# Research Interests

### Immersive Media <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faVrCardboard}/>

Immersive media research aims to involve multimedia communications systems to be more natural and with higher QoE, especially by imitating the physical world through digital simulation. I particularly researched it through VR/360 video and multisensorial aspects.

Some of my papers in the field are:

- ðŸ“„ [Subjective Evaluation of 360-degree Sensory Experiences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8901743)
- ðŸ“„ [An Authoring Model for Interactive 360 Videos](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9105958)

For me, some important researchers in this field are:

### Multimedia Systems <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faVideoCamera}/>

Users' consumption of multimedia content growing exponentially with the usage of the Internet, smart devices, IoT, and social media. This field address technological issues for enabling and improving such consumption, such as content delivery, adaptation, accessibility and personalization, multimedia for local networks, and others. I particularly addressed this field in contributions to the TV middleware technology called Ginga.

Some of my papers in the field are:

- ðŸ“„ [Advances in Ginga middleware for TV 2.5 (pt-br)](https://set.org.br/news-revista-da-set/artigo-news-revista-da-set/avancos-do-middleware-ginga-para-tv-2-5/)
- ðŸ“„ [Interactive 360-degree Videos in Ginga-NCL Using Head-Mounted-Displays as Second Screen Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3428658.3430972)
- ðŸ“„ [Extending multimedia languages to support multimodal user interactions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-016-3846-8)

### Video analysis <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPhotoVideo}/>

Video analysis, or video content analysis (VCA), focuses on understanding the multimedia content itself. 
Different than Multimedia Systems aspects of delivery and feasibility aspects, Video Analysis aims at automatically analyzing video to detect and determine temporal and spatial events. Usage scenarios are video retrieval and browsing, anomaly detection, and others. 

Some of my papers in the field are:

- ðŸ“„ [A Clustering-Based Method for Automatic Educational Video Recommendation Using Deep Face-Features of Lecturers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9327972/)
- ðŸ“„ [Unsupervised method for video action segmentation through spatio-temporal and positional-encoded embeddings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524273.3528187)

### Graph Signal Processing <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faDiagramProject}/>

Different than classical signal processing done on ordered axes, Graph Signal Processing (GSP) aims
to develop tools for processing data defined on irregular graph domains. Application areas for GSP include processing and analysis of sensor network data, biological data, machine learning, and others.
