# Research Interests

## Multimedia Systems

Users' consumption of multimedia content is growing exponentially with the Internet, smart devices, IoT, and social media usage. This field addresses technological issues for enabling and improving consumption, such as content delivery, adaptation, accessibility and personalization, multimedia for local networks, and others. 
I have particularly addressed this field, making contributions to multimedia communication and immersive media.

## Multimedia Communication <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faVideoCamera}/>

Multimedia communication deals with the delivery of multimedia data in digital networks. A multimedia communication infrastructure requires components such as protocols, services, middleware, and mechanisms to handle a well-defined quality of service (QoS).

Some of my contributions in the field are in 360 TV communication and its middleware:

- ðŸ“„ [Extending multimedia languages to support multimodal user interactions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-016-3846-8)

## Immersive Media <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faVrCardboard}/>

Immersive media research aims to make multimedia communications systems more natural and with higher QoE, especially by imitating the physical world through digital simulation. I particularly researched it through VR/360 video and multisensorial aspects.

Some of my contributions in the field are in 360 videos:

- ðŸ“„ [An Authoring Model for Interactive 360 Videos](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9105958)

## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and aims to design methods to leverage data and gradually improve its accuracy on a task.
I have particularly addressed the intersection of this field with Multimedia Systems, such as Computer Vision and Graph Signal Processing 

### Computer Vision <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPhotoVideo}/>

Computer Vision deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Unlike Multimedia Systems' aspects of delivery and feasibility, Computer Vision aims to analyze multimedia data automatically. Usage scenarios are video retrieval and browsing, anomaly detection, and others. 

Some of my contributions in the field are unsupervised video analysis:

- ðŸ“„ [A Clustering-Based Method for Automatic Educational Video Recommendation Using Deep Face-Features of Lecturers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9327972/)
- ðŸ“„ [Unsupervised method for video action segmentation through spatio-temporal and positional-encoded embeddings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524273.3528187)

For me, some important researchers in this field are:

ðŸŽ“ [Shaogang Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nhi0I8cAAAAJ)

### Graph Signal Processing <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faDiagramProject}/>

Different than classical signal processing done on ordered axes, Graph Signal Processing (GSP) aims to develop tools for processing data defined on irregular graph domains. Application areas for GSP include processing and analysis of sensor network data, biological data, machine learning, and others.
