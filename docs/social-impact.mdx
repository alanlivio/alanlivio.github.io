# Social Impact

I truly believe that technology can be a vehicle for social impact, especially in the multimedia field. Today, multimedia/web/video data are spread and are useful for accessibility, governance transparency, minority inclusion, social justice/activism, etc.

### Luiz Fernando Award/Workshop <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faAward}/>

I annually organize a workshop to promote Brazilian students/researchers to use Web/Multimedia systems to perform social impact.
